### Development Environment: Installation and Running

Install client dependencies and start the client server in the 'client' directory.

```sh
npm install
npm run serve
```

To run the server, first use `npm run build` in the client directory to build the Vue.js app first. Then, install server dependencies in the root directory and start the server.

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
